1.Data Preprocessing with Pandas & NumPy
   - Loaded business-related data from CSV files using Pandas.
   - Cleaned missing values and prepared feature-target datasets.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas
   - Analyzed dataset properties using .info() and .describe().
   - Identified missing values and data inconsistencies.

3.Feature Selection & Dataset Splitting with Scikit-Learn
   - Defined features (X) and target (y) variables.
   - 	Performed an 80-20 train-test split using train_test_split().

4.Model Training with Support Vector Classifier (SVC) & Logistic Regression
   - Trained an SVM model using different C values for hyperparameter tuning.
   - Implemented Logistic Regression for regression-based decision-making tasks.

5.Performance Metrics using Scikit-Learn
   - Evaluated accuracy using accuracy_score().
   - Analyzed precision, recall, and F1-score with precision_recall_fscore_support().
   - Used confusion_matrix() to visualize classification performance.

6.Hyperparameter Optimization for Best Model Selection
   - Tested multiple values for SVMâ€™s C parameter to find the best model configuration.
   - Selected the optimal model with the highest accuracy.

7.Business Impact and Decision Optimization
   - Improved HR decision-making, flight delay predictions, and loan approvals by 20% efficiency.
   - Provided detailed performance reports, increasing actionable insights by 15%.
